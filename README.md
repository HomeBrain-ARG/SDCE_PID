## **1) Project Summary:** <br />

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to design a PID controller to perform vehicle trajectory tracking. Given a trajectory as an array of locations, and a simulation environment (the vehicle with possible perturbations), you will design and code a PID controller and test its efficiency on the CARLA simulator used in the industry.<br />

The project will provide the dynamic model of the vehicle as well as an approximate distribution of the possible perturbations. The code to use the simulation environment (CARLA) will be provided as well as a template in C++ for the controller.<br />

The deliverable will be the code, explanations about how you chose the parameters, as well as a result of the simulation with analysis of the results.<br />

### **Project Steps Overview:**<br />
- Design the PID controller in C++.<br />
- Integrate the controller with the CARLA simulator.<br />
- Tune the parameters using a technique.<br />
- Explain a strategy to test the controller and perform the test.<br />
- Create plots to show how successful the controller is as well as the simulator video.<br />
- Talk about how the controller recovered/etc. Can be a sentence.<br />

### **Project Dependencies Overview:**<br />
- CARLA simulator in a workspace.<br />
- A C++ solver open sources and used in the industry.<br />
- Code to interact with the CARLA simulator.<br />
